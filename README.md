# Video_Game_Sales
Overview
This project focuses on predicting video game sales using machine learning techniques. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately forecast sales based on various features such as year of release, genre, platform, and region-specific sales figures. The analysis involves data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to determine the effectiveness of the predictive model.

Analysis Workflow
1. Data Exploration and Preprocessing
The dataset is first explored to understand the distribution of features and identify any missing values or outliers. Key steps include:

Handling Missing Values: Missing data is addressed by either filling with appropriate values or removing incomplete entries.
Feature Engineering: New features are derived from existing ones to enhance the model's predictive power.
